# Crossbinder Servlet

Provides integration between Crossbinder and servlets in a standard J2EE
environment. Allows servlets to be injected with dependencies and runtime
preferences.

Crossbinder servlet integration requires a minimum of servlet specification 3.0
to be supported by the container.

Further details on setup and integration is available from the project page at
